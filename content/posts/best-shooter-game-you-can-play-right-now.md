Are you looking for the best first-person shooters that prove the genre is alive, louder, and more intense than ever? The classic "dog days" of gaming gave us raw, unforgettable chaos with titles like Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament, forging a generation of shooters with unpredictability and style. Modern shooters haven't lost that sparkle!

From cinematic campaigns to insane multiplayer mayhem, here are the 18 best shooter games you can play right now based on the video:

## 1. battlefield 6

![Battlefield 6](/images/shooter/Battlefield-6.webp)

Battlefield 6 finally leans back into the kind of large scale chaos the series built its name on. Matches feel busy in the best way. The maps are wide and open with multiple fronts happening at the same time, so you are never stuck running in a straight line toward a single objective. The changing weather and the shift from day to night are not just for show. A sandstorm, heavy rain, or sudden darkness can slow a push, open a new route, or give your squad the chance to sneak in and take a point.

Destruction plays a big role again. You can punch holes through walls to clear campers, drop a whole floor to stop a squad from holding an angle, or remove cover and force a team out into the open. It makes firefights feel unpredictable and it rewards players who think on the fly instead of just holding one position the entire round. When everything starts collapsing and vehicles roll in at the same time, it creates those classic moments that only this series can really deliver.

Portal mode is getting a lot of attention for a reason. People are using it to build custom experiences that range from serious competitive setups to completely wild modes that should not work but somehow do. It gives the game a long life because the community keeps coming up with new ideas instead of waiting for official playlists.

A lot of long time players are saying this is the first entry in years that actually feels like Battlefield again. Classes matter more, revives are happening in the middle of the fight, and support players are not just background characters. When squads move together and play their roles, the round changes fast.

If you scroll through Reddit, the most common posts are about the unscripted moments. Players talk about jumping out of a jet to land on a rooftop, a building coming down right as a team captures the objective, or a last second revive that saves the match. Many also say the gunplay feels more solid and grounded, closer to the older titles but smoother.

There are still some complaints. Performance can dip when the server is full and everything is exploding at once, and balance between certain vehicles and infantry is still being debated. But even in those threads, the tone is different from past launches. Most people are not arguing about whether the game is fun. They are talking about what needs to be tuned because they are already enjoying it.

Right now the overall mood from both veterans and new players is simple. The game brings back the large scale sandbox fights, the teamwork, and the random cinematic moments that made people stick with the series for years.

You may try the game by downloading it below, though it is only a campaign version considering that you need to buy it to have the full version. Nonetheless, it is better to try it before buying.

## 2. warhammer 40,000: darktide

![Darktide](/images/shooter/Warhamer.webp)

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide takes the co-op formula from Vermintide 2 and pushes it into a much heavier, more gun focused direction, and that shift works better than most people expected. The Cantrell MG12 infantry lasgun has that clean, precise feel that lets you drop elites before they reach the team, while the autoguns are pure chaos control, sending entire waves into ragdoll piles when a horde gets too close. Swapping between melee and ranged in the middle of a rush feels natural, and when a squad is in sync the combat flows in a really satisfying way.

The class progression gives you room to experiment instead of locking you into one role. You can build for support, toughness, crowd control, or straight damage, and small changes in your tree actually affect how you play during missions. It keeps the grind from feeling pointless because you are always chasing a setup that fits your style.

Mortis Trials leans fully into the power fantasy. It is wave based, faster, and far more intense, with more enemies on screen and more chances to test high end builds. It is the kind of mode people jump into when they just want nonstop action and bigger rewards.

A lot of players on Reddit say the gunplay ended up being the biggest surprise. Early on there were concerns that it would never feel as good as the melee, but now you see posts praising how weighty the weapons are, how strong the sound design is, and how satisfying it is to delete a special before it wrecks the run. The atmosphere also gets constant mentions. The lighting, the scale of the hive city, and the constant background noise make every mission feel tense even when you are just moving between fights.

There are still the usual complaints. Performance can dip during the most crowded moments, and weapon balance is always being debated, especially at higher difficulties. But the overall tone has shifted a lot compared to launch. Veteran players who stuck with it keep saying it is in a much better place now, and new players are coming in and getting hooked by how brutal and cooperative the combat feels.

At its best, Darktide is loud, messy, and completely dependent on teamwork. When the squad holds a narrow corridor against a full horde, revives are going off, ammo is running low, and someone clutches the fight at the last second, it delivers the exact kind of co-op chaos that the setting deserves.

## 3. borderlands 4

![Borderlands 4](/images/shooter/Borderland-4.webp)

Borderlands 4 keeps the chaos cranked all the way up, but the biggest improvement is how much better the core shooting feels. Guns have more weight, recoil patterns are easier to read, and the new weapon variations make loot drops exciting again instead of just being stat upgrades. The grappling hook changes the flow of fights in a big way. You are not just strafing in circles anymore. You are pulling yourself onto rooftops, diving into mobs, or escaping when things get messy, and it makes every arena feel more alive.

The loop is still the reason people stay for hours. Run a mission, watch loot explode everywhere, argue with friends over who gets what, then jump straight into the next fight. Co-op remains the heart of the game and it scales well whether you are playing with one other person or a full squad. Solo is still fun, but with a team the screen turns into pure noise in the best possible way, with skills, explosions, and legendary drops going off at the same time.

On Steam reviews, a lot of players are praising the gunplay and mobility, saying this is the first time since Borderlands 2 that the moment to moment combat feels this smooth. Epic users keep mentioning performance and how seamless co-op matchmaking has been compared to past launches. Reddit threads are full of clips of ridiculous builds melting bosses in seconds or people grappling across the map to clutch a revive. On YouTube, most early impressions focus on how much faster the game feels and how the new movement system fixes the old “stand and shoot” rhythm.

There are still some familiar complaints. The story is getting mixed reactions and a few players think certain legendary effects are overtuned, but even in critical posts the gameplay itself gets credit. The general mood across all platforms is that the series finally moved forward instead of playing it safe. It is loud, fast, packed with loot, and very easy to lose track of time once the drops start rolling.

## 4. wolfenstein ii: the new colossus

![Wolfenstein II](/images/shooter/wolfenstein.webp)

Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is pure momentum from the moment the shooting starts. Every weapon feels heavy and dangerous, enemies react to every hit, and the levels are built to let you play as reckless or as tactical as you want. The dual-wield system is still the star of the show. Carrying two shotguns, two assault rifles, or mixing completely different weapons turns fights into loud, close-range chaos, and it never really gets old kicking open a door and clearing a room in seconds.

What gives the action real weight is the story behind it. This is a much more personal look at B.J. Blazkowicz, digging into his past, his trauma, and why he keeps going even when his body is falling apart. The game moves from intense firefights to quiet, uncomfortable moments, then suddenly throws something completely absurd at you. That mix of serious and ridiculous is very much its identity, and it works because the characters around B.J. feel human and grounded.

Steam reviews often highlight how satisfying the gunplay is and how well the game encourages aggressive movement instead of hiding behind cover. On Reddit you still see people talking about their favorite weapon combinations and the way certain late game missions just turn into controlled mayhem. YouTube playthroughs and retrospectives usually focus on the narrative, especially the performance of B.J. and how bold the game was with its tone and themes.

The most common criticisms are about the difficulty spikes and the reliance on armored enemies in some sections, which can slow down the flow if you are not equipped for them. Even so, the overall reception remains very positive years later. Most players remember it as a shooter that committed fully to its style, delivered emotional story beats that actually landed, and backed it all up with combat that feels fast, brutal, and constantly in your face

## 5. call of duty: black ops 6

![Black Ops 6](/images/shooter/Call-of-duty-6.webp)

Black Ops 6 feels like a confident entry that understands why people stuck with the series for so long. The campaign is more experimental than expected, moving between set pieces and quieter, choice driven moments that break the usual run and gun rhythm. The 90s setting gives it a distinct style, from the music to the environments, and the gunplay has that tight, punchy feedback that makes even short encounters satisfying.

Multiplayer is where the new omni movement really changes the pace. Being able to dive, strafe, and chain actions smoothly makes every fight more unpredictable and a lot faster without turning it into pure chaos. It rewards players who keep moving and think about positioning, but it still feels familiar enough that longtime fans can jump in without needing to relearn everything. Maps are built to take advantage of that mobility, so flanking routes and vertical plays happen constantly.

Zombies is getting a lot of love for bringing back the old atmosphere. The round based structure, the gradual power climb, and the need for real teamwork make it feel closer to the classic era than the more experimental versions. Setting up a holdout spot, scrambling for a revive, and barely surviving a late round still creates those long sessions where nobody wants to leave the lobby.

On Steam and Reddit, many players say this is the most complete package the series has had in years, especially praising how each mode feels fully developed instead of one carrying the rest. YouTube reviews keep highlighting the movement system and how it raises the skill ceiling in multiplayer while making the game more fun to watch. There are still the usual balance debates and matchmaking complaints, but the overall tone is that this entry finally found the right mix of nostalgia and new ideas without leaning too hard on either.

## 6. counter-strike 2

![Counter-Strike 2](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/csgo/images/csgo_react/social/cs2.jpg)

Counter-Strike 2 keeps the same razor sharp foundation that made the series untouchable in competitive play. The movement still punishes sloppy positioning, recoil control still separates casual players from serious ones, and every round is a mental battle of utility usage, timing, and map control. The visual upgrade is clean without getting in the way, and the new smoke behavior adds small but meaningful mind games. You can carve openings through a smoke with a few bullets or disrupt a plant with a well placed grenade, which makes even familiar bomb sites feel different.

What stands out most is how little the core formula needed to change. The economy system, the importance of sound cues, and the value of teamwork are all intact. A single player holding an angle can still shut down an entire push, and a perfectly timed flash can flip a losing round. It remains one of those games where improvement comes from hundreds of small lessons rather than a single big breakthrough.

Across Steam and Reddit, the common reaction is relief that it still feels like Counter-Strike. Most players talk about the subtick system and how it changes the way peeking and shooting feel, with some saying it made gunfights more consistent and others still adjusting to the timing. YouTube breakdowns from both pros and long time creators focus on how quickly the competitive scene settled into the new version, which says a lot about how strong the foundation is. Even the usual complaints about matchmaking and performance show up in the middle of praise for how good the actual matches feel.

It is still not an easy game to get into if you are new. The skill ceiling is as high as ever and the pressure in close matches can be exhausting, but that is also the reason people queue for “one more.” Few shooters can create that level of tension where every footstep matters and a single mistake costs the round. Counter-Strike 2 does not try to be flashy. It just tightens what was already one of the most demanding and rewarding competitive shooters ever made.

## 7. metro exodus

![Metro Exodus](/images/shooter/metro-exudos.webp)

Metro Exodus slows the pace down in a way that works in its favor. Leaving the safety of the train and stepping into those wide, hostile landscapes makes every trip into the wild feel like a risk. Ammo is limited, filters are always running out, and even a small firefight can go wrong if you rush in without planning. It blends survival and shooting so well that simply preparing for an expedition becomes part of the tension.

The weapon system adds a lot to that feeling of being on a long journey. You are not just picking up stronger guns. You are constantly modifying what you have, swapping parts, cleaning them, and adjusting your loadout depending on the environment. A silent crossbow for human enemies, a revolver for emergencies, a heavily modded rifle for open fights. It makes every piece of gear feel personal because you have carried it through multiple regions.

Many Steam reviews talk about how immersive the world is, especially the way each area tells its own story without forcing you through nonstop action. Reddit threads often mention the quiet moments, like watching the sunrise from the Aurora or traveling back after a long mission with barely any ammo left. On YouTube, a lot of players highlight the sound design and the dynamic weather, saying it is one of the few shooters where simply moving through the environment is as engaging as combat.

What keeps the slower pacing from dragging is the constant sense of progress. The train moves, seasons change, and your crew evolves along the way. You always feel like you are heading somewhere, not just clearing levels. That forward momentum, mixed with the tension of exploring alone in such dangerous spaces, gives the game a mood that sticks with you long after you put it down.

## 8. system shock (remake)

The System Shock remake brings back that classic slow, methodical style and trusts you to figure things out on your own. It does not rush you from one objective to the next. You explore Citadel Station at your own pace, backtrack through areas once you unlock new paths, and manage your inventory carefully because every item matters. Combat is deliberate and sometimes uncomfortable, which fits the atmosphere. Even a single enemy can be a problem if you waste ammo or walk in unprepared.

What makes it stand out is how closely it sticks to immersive sim design. There are multiple ways to approach a situation, logs and audio messages that slowly explain what happened, and a constant sense that you are alone in a hostile place with limited resources. The interface keeps that retro complexity, but it feels more readable now, so the challenge comes from the decisions you make rather than fighting the controls.

A lot of Steam reviews praise how faithful it is to the original while still feeling modern enough for new players. You see people on Reddit sharing stories about getting lost for hours in a good way, solving a problem by accident, or suddenly realizing they opened a shortcut that loops back to a familiar area. On YouTube, many retrospectives focus on the sound design and SHODAN’s presence, saying the remake keeps the same oppressive mood that made the original so memorable.

It is not a fast game and it does not try to be. The tension comes from exploration, from managing your resources, and from not knowing what is waiting in the next corridor. For players who enjoy being dropped into a world and left to survive through observation and experimentation, the remake captures that 90s spirit without feeling outdated.

## 9. valorant

Valorant sits in a comfortable middle ground between serious tactical play and something you can jump into without hundreds of hours of experience. The gunplay still rewards precision and good crosshair placement, but the abilities give you tools to recover from mistakes or create opportunities even if your aim is not perfect. The bright visuals and clear map design also make it easier to read what is happening compared to more punishing tactical shooters.

Each agent changes the flow of a round in a noticeable way. Smokes, flashes, recon tools, and movement skills let you contribute to the team even on an off day, so you are not stuck feeling useless if you lose a few duels. At the same time, the economy system and the importance of positioning keep it competitive enough that coordinated teams will always have the advantage. It is approachable, but it does not lose that high skill ceiling once you start climbing ranks.

A lot of new players on Reddit say it was their first real tactical shooter because the learning curve feels manageable and the game teaches its systems well. Steam discussions about similar games often point to Valorant as the easier entry point because of its clarity and shorter match pacing. On YouTube, many beginner guides focus on how quickly you can understand the basics while still showing how deep the agent compositions and map strategies become at higher levels.

It is not without the usual frustrations. Smurfing, rank pressure, and balance changes around certain agents are constant topics in the community. Still, the general mood is that it is one of the most welcoming competitive shooters available. You can play casually with friends and have fun, then slowly take it more seriously without needing to switch to a different game once you get better.

## 10. superhot

SUPERHOT is one of those rare shooters that feels completely different the moment you touch it. Time only moves when you move, so every step, turn, and shot becomes a decision instead of a reflex. A single room can play out like a puzzle where you dodge a bullet in slow motion, grab a weapon out of the air, and clear the space in a few seconds that took several attempts to figure out. It is simple on the surface, but the precision and timing it demands make every successful run feel earned.

The minimalist art style does a lot of the heavy lifting. Bright red enemies, white environments, and the shattering glass effect when you land a hit make each encounter look like a choreographed action scene. There is no clutter, no distractions, just you reading movement and planning the next action. Even after short sessions you start thinking differently, waiting for the right moment to move instead of rushing in.

Many players on Reddit describe it as a shooter that people who do not even like shooters end up loving because it feels more like solving a problem than winning a firefight. On YouTube, most clips are stylish replays showing perfect runs, and that alone says a lot about how satisfying the mechanics are. Reviews often mention how the campaign is not very long, but almost all of them follow that up by saying the challenge modes and endless runs are where the real obsession starts.

It never tries to overwhelm you with content or realism. Everything is built around that core idea of movement and control, and it sticks to it all the way through. The result is a small, focused game that feels fresh every time you return to it, even when you already know the solution to a level.

## 11. halo: the master chief collection

Halo: The Master Chief Collection is the most complete way to run through the full John-117 journey without jumping across different consoles and generations. Playing the games in order makes the evolution of the series feel natural, from the slower, more methodical combat of the early titles to the faster, more ability driven later entries. The option to swap between classic and remastered visuals on the fly is still a standout feature, especially in Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2, where the difference is night and day.

The technical turnaround is what really changed its reputation. What launched as a broken package is now one of the smoothest shooter collections on PC and console. Load times are fast, matchmaking is reliable, and running the games at up to 120 FPS makes the gunplay feel far more responsive than it ever did before. Even small things like the unified progression system and customizable multiplayer playlists make it easy to stay in the loop for hours.

On Steam, a lot of reviews talk about coming back after years and being surprised at how polished everything feels. Reddit is full of first time players experiencing the campaigns in chronological order and longtime fans rediscovering old multiplayer maps that now play better than they remember. Many YouTube retrospectives call it one of the best recovery stories for a major release, pointing out how consistent updates slowly turned it into the version people expected from the start.

With six campaigns, Firefight, custom games, and a massive multiplayer suite that covers multiple Halo eras, it is less a single game and more a long term hub for the series. Whether you are there for the story, ranked matches, or just co-op with friends, it finally delivers the kind of smooth, modern experience that lets the classics shine without their original technical limits.

## 12. doom eternal

Doom Eternal is built around constant forward pressure. Standing still gets you killed, and the game teaches that lesson in seconds. Every fight is a loop of pushing toward enemies for health, setting them on fire for armor, and using the right weapon for the right target. Once it clicks, the combat feels like controlled chaos where you are dashing through projectiles, swapping guns mid-air, and clearing an arena without breaking the rhythm. It is aggressive in a way very few shooters manage.

The performance is just as impressive as the combat design. It runs smoothly on almost everything, from high refresh rate PC setups to older consoles and even the Switch, without losing the speed that the gameplay depends on. The visual clarity, fast load times, and stable frame rate make it easy to stay locked in during the most intense encounters, which is crucial for a game that demands that much movement and awareness.

A lot of players on Steam and Reddit point to how satisfying the combat loop is once you stop trying to play it like a traditional shooter. YouTube is full of high level runs that look more like choreography than gameplay, with perfect weapon swaps and movement chains that show how deep the mechanics go. Even people who struggled at the start often end up saying the same thing after a few hours, that it becomes one of the most rewarding FPS systems once you learn to play on its terms.

It is not a relaxed experience and it never tries to be. The difficulty can be brutal, especially in later arenas where multiple high tier demons spawn at once, but that pressure is the whole identity of the game. When you finish a fight with low health, no ammo, and everything around you in pieces, it delivers that exact power fantasy the Doom Slayer is supposed to represent.

---

## 13. titanfall 2

Titanfall 2 is still one of the smoothest feeling shooters ever made. The movement system lets you chain wall runs, slides, double jumps, and grapples in a way that turns every map into a playground. Once you understand the flow, you stop thinking about the controls and just move, bouncing across rooftops and cutting through interiors without touching the ground for more than a second. It gives multiplayer a speed and freedom that very few games have matched.

The campaign is a big reason the game is remembered so fondly. Instead of feeling like a short tutorial for multiplayer, it constantly introduces new mechanics and level ideas, then moves on before they get repetitive. The time shifting mission, the factory sequence, and the open combat spaces all feel distinct. At the center of it is the relationship with BT-7274, which gives the story real weight without slowing the pace. By the end, the bond between pilot and titan feels earned.

Many Steam reviews describe it as a must play for anyone who enjoys FPS games, often pointing out how surprising the campaign is for a multiplayer focused title. On Reddit you still see clips of players pulling off long movement chains or perfectly timed titan drops that turn the match around. YouTube retrospectives almost always call it one of the most underrated shooters of its generation and praise how well the mechanics hold up years later.

Even with a smaller active player base compared to newer titles, the multiplayer remains chaotic in the best way, mixing pilot combat and titan battles in the same match. Whether you are flying across the map at full speed or calling down a titan for a last push, the sense of momentum never really stops, and that is what makes it so hard to replace once you get used to it.

## 14. s.t.a.l.k.e.r. 2: heart of chornobyl
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl leans fully into the harsh, unpredictable nature that defined the earlier games. Moving through the Zone is slow and nerve-racking in the best way. You are constantly checking your ammo, watching your radiation levels, and listening for distant gunfire that might mean a firefight or a pack of mutants heading your way. Exploration feels meaningful because every abandoned building or hidden stash can be the difference between barely surviving and actually being prepared for the next encounter.

Gunfights are messy and dangerous rather than clean and heroic. Enemies do not politely wait their turn, and when different factions collide with mutants in the middle of a storm, the situation can spiral fast. Scavenging for food, artifacts, and weapon parts becomes its own reward, especially when you make it back to a safe area with just enough supplies to push out again. It captures that feeling of being a fragile scavenger in a hostile world instead of an unstoppable action hero.

Across Reddit and Steam, a lot of players say the rough edges are part of the identity. There are plenty of stories about strange AI behavior, unexpected deaths, or physics glitches, but they are often told in a way that sounds more like war stories than complaints. On YouTube, long play sessions focus on the atmosphere, dynamic encounters, and the way a simple trip across the map can turn into a full survival scenario because of weather, anomalies, and random fights breaking out.

It is not a comfortable game and it does not try to smooth everything out. The systems can be punishing and the pacing is deliberately slow, but that tension is what makes every successful expedition feel earned. When you finally reach shelter at night with your gear intact and enough supplies for another run into the Zone, the sense of relief is unlike anything in more forgiving shooters.

---

## 15. half-life 2

![Half-Life 2](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/220/header.jpg)

Half-Life 2 might show its age on a technical level, but the design still feels sharp in a way many newer shooters struggle to match. The pacing is the real secret. It constantly shifts between combat, quiet exploration, vehicle sections, and physics driven puzzles, so nothing ever overstays its welcome. You are always being pushed forward, always seeing something new, and the world tells its story without pulling control away from you.

The gravity gun is still one of the most memorable mechanics in any FPS. What starts as a simple tool for moving objects turns into a full combat weapon that lets you clear rooms using whatever is lying around. It changes how you look at the environment, because every saw blade, crate, or piece of debris becomes potential ammo. That kind of interaction was groundbreaking at the time and it still feels fresh because it is built into the level design rather than used as a gimmick.

Many Steam reviews come from players who replay it every few years and are surprised by how well it holds up, especially the atmosphere in places like Ravenholm and the coastal highway chapters. On Reddit you often see discussions about how natural the storytelling feels, with no traditional cutscenes and characters reacting to you in real time. YouTube retrospectives regularly call it one of the most important shooters ever made, not because of nostalgia but because so many modern games still follow the structure it established.

Even now it is easy to get pulled into its rhythm for hours without noticing the time. The shooting, the physics, and the seamless world design all work together to create a sense of immersion that does not rely on modern graphics. It is one of those rare games where the ideas are so strong that the experience remains compelling no matter how many years pass.

## 16. elite dangerous


On the surface, it's a space simulator where you can trade, fight, explore, or mine. But spend more than a few hours in its vast galaxy, and it becomes an experience centered on absolute freedom.

---

## 17. escape from tarkov


Escape from Tarkov delivers a brutal, high-stakes, hardcore first-person survival game. It mixes elements of tactical combat, looting, and base building into an unforgiving world where every choice matters.

---

## 18. hunt: showdown


With sound design that has won awards for its realism and ability to heighten tension, this game is beautiful and terrifying. Mouse aiming provides the precision needed for the high stakes combat, where every shot counts whether you're stalking prey or escaping with the bounty.
