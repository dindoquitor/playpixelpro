I’m the person behind PlayPixelPro — a gamer, builder, and multi-platform streamer who enjoys both high-end gameplay and the systems that make everything run.

{{< watch-live >}}


## What PlayPixelPro is

PlayPixelPro is my digital lab.

It connects everything I actually use:

- the games I play  
- the hardware I run  
- the servers I deploy  
- the tools behind my streams  
- the workflow that powers my content  

If I write about it, it means I tested it in a real setup.

## Gaming

Gaming is at the core of everything I do.

My content focuses on:

- AAA and upcoming titles  
- racing games and driving setups  
- real performance and long-session gameplay  
- controllers, wheels, and gaming hardware  

Not just first impressions — but how these games perform when streamed and played for hours.

## Streaming

Streaming is more than pressing “Go Live.”

I’m constantly working on:

- performance optimization  
- scene and audio workflow  
- hardware upgrades  
- stable multi-platform output  

The goal is simple: high-quality live content with a clean and reliable setup.

## Tech, self-hosting, and builds

I also run my own services and platforms.

You will see content here about:

- Docker deployments  
- self-hosted applications  
- homelab setups  
- media and creator servers  
- performance-focused configurations  

Building my own stack gives me full control over my content and workflow.

## The platform behind this site

This site runs on:

- Hugo  
- Terminal theme  
- a fast, minimal, performance-first setup  

Built the same way I build my systems — clean and efficient.

## Who this is for

This is for people who:

- play and stream games  
- care about performance and clean setups  
- run their own services  
- enjoy upgrading their workflow  

If your gaming setup, streaming setup, and homelab are all connected, you’re in the right place.

## What’s next

I’m continuously working on:

- better streams  
- deeper setup guides  
- new AAA game coverage  
- improved creator workflows  

Always upgrading. One step at a time.
